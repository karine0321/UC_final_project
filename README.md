# UC_final_project

For the Urban Computing course final project ***Assessing the Hospital Beds Configuration in The US, EspeciallyWhen Facing COVID Pandemic***.



All the codes and figures used in the project are shown in the notebooks:

**preprocess_data**: Preprocessing the datasets.

**radial_profile**: Calculate the radial profile for each state of US. 

**discrepancy_effort**: Calculate the *Discrepancy* and *EMD* of each state based on the radial profile.

**Regression**: Constructed a regression model according to the features which can predict the estimated bed for each state.

**Visualize_radial_profile**: Visualize the radial profile on the shapefiles.

**Visualize_discrepancy_effort**: Visualize the *Discrepancy* and *EMD* on the shapefiles.
